# 🏦 BankUml: Banking System Simulation


Welcome to **BankUml**, a Java-based banking application designed to simulate core banking operations such as account management, transactions, and receipts.  
This project demonstrates the use of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles, including **Inheritance**, **Encapsulation**, **Abstraction**, and **Polymorphism**, strictly following the provided UML diagram.

---

## 📌 Features

- **Account Management**: Create and manage multiple types of bank accounts.
- **Transaction Handling**: Simulate payments and generate receipts.
- **UML-Driven Design**: Class structure directly follows the given UML diagram.
- **Test Coverage**: Includes basic unit tests for key operations like `pay()` and `receipt()`.
